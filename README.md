# Supdock
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/supdock.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/supdock)

What's Up, Dock(er)? A slightly more visual way to interact with the docker daemon. Supdock is a wrapper for the docker command meaning you can still use all of the other `docker` commands without issues.

## Why
Repetitive use of `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker stats` and `docker exec -ti` when troubleshooting  complex container setups can get chaotic. Supdock aims to optimize and speed up your workflow using docker.

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g supdock
```

If you don't want to use `supdock` and `docker` separately you can just set an alias.

```bash
alias docker="supdock"
```

## Known Issues
- Passing flags to `supdock` (eg. `supdock rm -f foo`) when using one of the custom commands can result in an unknown option error.

This is because [`commander.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) interferes and doesn't know the flag. So if you encounter a flag that throws you this error, feel free to post an issue so I can add it for you.
